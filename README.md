# Video Game Sales Database

The main purpose of this project was to gain some SQL practice. I kept it all relatively simple, and found a simple to work with dataset that seemed interesting. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales. I just did a basic EDA, found the top-selling platform, top-selling and worst-selling genre, which ps console sold the most games, etc. There wasn't *too* much to work with, but it was fun and I gained some pratice. The data set was very outdated unfortunately. I wanted to create a visual of my findings, but I would have to update the data set first, and the code that generated the data is also outdated. . . so it's a project to keep in mind for the future, but will take more time than I have available right now. Still, I did get some additional SQL experience, and it also serves as proof that I at least know some SQL (though this hardly showcases all I can do), so overall it was a win.
